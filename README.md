# INPTDAT

The INterdisciplinary Plasma Technology DATa platform INPTDAT is an open source research data repository build on top of the Open Data Platform [DKAN](https://getdkan.org). Instances of INPTDAT are currently operated by [Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP)](https://www.inptdat.de) and the [Research Department Plasmas with Complex Interactions](https://rdpcidat.rub.de) at Ruhr-Universität Bochum.

## Features

INPTDAT extends the fully made [Drupal 7 version of DKAN](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan-drops-7) by the following features:

* Addition of plasma specific metadata fields to the dataset content type for implementation of the plasma metadata schema, Plasma-MDS. 
* Plasma specific topics for thematic selection of content.

INPTDAT may be used as a basis for other institutional repositories to support the publication and linking of research data in the plasma community in accordance with unified (meta)data models supporting the [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and data driven plasma science. Individual research data repositories implementing the plasma metadata schema, Plasma-MDS and providing appropriate APIs for metadata harvesting will be linked together at the central INPTDAT instance at https://www.inptdat.de.

## Installation

The installation of the data platform is analogous to the installation of DKAN. Hence, follow these steps to deploy INPTDAT:

* Create the database following the [Drupal standard procedure](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/install/step-2-create-the-database).
* Download or clone the INPTDAT repository.
* Follow the [DKAN base installation](https://dkan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/basic.html#installation) instructions to install INPTDAT.

### Upgrading INPTDAT

Follow the [DKAN basic upgrade](https://dkan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/maintaining.html#basic-upgrades) instructions to update INPTDAT. Most of the INPTDAT specific code is maintained separated from the DKAN base code in the `sites` folder to avoid overwriting. Use this repository as a code base to benefit from all plasma-specific developments and updates tested for compatibility with the INPTDAT implementation.
